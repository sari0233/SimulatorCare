## Introduction
Rehabilitation methods for patients with neurological conditions often lack variety and fail to provide an immersive experience. SimulatorCare leverages the power of virtual reality technology to create captivating virtual environments that engage MS patients in enjoyable exercises. By immersing patients in these virtual environments, SimulatorCare offers a novel approach to rehabilitation, promoting motivation and increasing adherence to treatment.

## Features
SimulatorCare offers the following features:

1. **Training Module**: A highly immersive training module that transports users to virtual environments specially designed to stimulate their physical abilities. Users will be guided through purposeful movements and exercises that target specific parts of their body, expanding their range of motion and improving coordination.

2. **Swimming Module**: An immersive VR exercise designed to promote upper body movement and coordination. By mimicking swimming motions with their hands, patients can navigate through captivating aquatic environments, overcoming obstacles and challenges that simulate real-world swimming experiences.

3. **Rowing Module**: An exciting VR experience where patients embark on an adventurous journey in the vast ocean. Through realistic rowing motions using VR controllers, patients engage their upper body muscles. The immersive nature of the exercise makes it more enjoyable and engaging.
